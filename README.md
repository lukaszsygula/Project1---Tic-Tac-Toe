This is a project of a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game. 

In this classic two-player game, you compete with a friend, aiming to place three of your marks in a row, column, or diagonal. 

The game offers strategic moves and tense decision-making, resulting in either a clear victory for one player or a draw if all cells are filled.
